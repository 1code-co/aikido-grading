# Some General Advice for Grading

Show the technique, don't show off. A grading is not a time for fancy Aikido. Show the most basic form of every technique (the kihon form), as cleanly as possible.

When you take ukemi, as in every practice, you want to help your partner do the best technique possible. This means, of course, that you don't throw yourself, but rather you provide an honest, but not difficult, attack, and work to keep the connection to tori.

Grade at half speed. Your body will be flooding with adrenaline. Aim for half speed, and you should come out about right.
